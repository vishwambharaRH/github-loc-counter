# Github line-of-code counter

This is a simple line of code counter that I am making to use on my GitHub repositories, as I wanted a good way to measure my own coding metrics without having to use any third-party options like I currently have on my GitHub profile README.

This is not intended to be a commercial/multiperson use project, but I will be certainly open to sharing it, which is why this repository is public.
If there are any easy improvements that can be done that I was too dumb to think of, raise an issue and I'll look at it when I come on GitHub, which is usually once an hour when I'm awake.

## Ideal usage scenario
Essentially should show up on my public profile README as a section that shows total lines of code across the top 8 languages I have used across all my repositories. 
I will actively exclude forks, archived repositories and makefiles from the count.
